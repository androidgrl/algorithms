Analysis of Binary Search

Binary search assumes an array that is already sorted.
It searches for the location of an element with a specific
value.
It guesses at the midpoint between the max and min each time.
Since the maximum number of times that you can divide a number
by two is log base 2 n.  So that is the maximum run time for
a binary search.
